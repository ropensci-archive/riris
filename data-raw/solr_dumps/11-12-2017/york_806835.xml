                  <str>This test is designed to measure phonological decoding (or "recoding") in L2 French, understood as the sub-lexical process of converting written symbols into sounds using knowledge of the language's spelling-sound correspondences. The four different versions of the test each contain the same items, but in different orders. The test was designed for beginner learners of French in English secondary schools (age 11-13). It uses words which are likely to be unknown to learners from the target population. This is argued to give the test good face validity (i.e. it is likely that participants are unable to retrieve pre-stored phonological forms for the target words and are unable to sight-recognize the items). The items in the test were selected to provide three or more examples of each of a range of French graphemes. Items are also of similar phonological and graphic length (all are bisyllables with 6-8 letters; almost all contain 4-6 graphemes). Words resembling English words, in whole or in part, were also avoided as far as possible. The use of real French words - rather than pseudowords, which would have allowed the target graphemes to be covered using a smaller set of test items - was chosen on ethical-pedagogical grounds as well for reasons of test validity (see Papagno, Valentine and Baddeley, 1991). However, this does introduce some potentially confounding variables which could not be controlled for. Note that the test has been slightly updated from the version used in the article cited: following further piloting, one item has been replaced and some others re-ordered, to increase test validity.</str>
