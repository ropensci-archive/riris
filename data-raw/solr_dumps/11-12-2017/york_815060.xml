In each of the two experimental tasks, the participants received the description of three English universities and the prompt in English, explaining that they had to write a letter to their friend´s parents giving a recommendation for a university which they had had to choose out of the provided options. When choosing a university, the participants had to take into account a number of predefined criteria (for example, availability of personalized tuition, safety of the place to live, etc.). In the simple task, the participants had to consider three simple requirements, which were not contradictory and were rather easy to accommodate, so that the choice of the university was rather obvious and easy to justify. By contrast, in the complex task, the requirements to take into account were contradictory, and none of the available options met all the requisites, assuming that in this way the participants had to employ their reasoning abilities more intensively in order to justify their choice in a convincing manner.</str>
